## Research: 

```markdown
Research Interests: 

- Bioinformatics: genetics of parasite-host interactions
- Archaeology: archaeolmetallurgy of SE Europe (Neolithic - Bronze Age), connections between trade routes and the movements of people

Research Experience: 

- **2015-2019 Bronze Age Off-Tell Archaeology (BAKOTA) Project**: Archaeological research project investigating Bronze Age social dynamics and structures in the Körös Rivers region in SE Hungary. My work on the project has included QGIS mapping of metal distributions, tracing and hypothesizing of trade routes, statistical analyses, and examinations of the possible social implications of metal ownership.
- **2018-2019 Genetic analysis (RNASeq) of of New World Screwworm, _Cochliomyia hominivorax_**: Bioinformatics research into the functions of genes at different life stages of _C. hominivorax_, with implications for targets for control of this pest.
